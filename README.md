# Book4U

Book4U is a streamlined facility booking system designed for non-registered campus facilities. It provides a convenient way for students to reserve spaces for group meetings, events, or projects. The project is live and accessible at [https://syal-2ae9b.firebaseapp.com/](https://syal-2ae9b.firebaseapp.com/).

## Problem

At NUS RC4 (Residential College 4), the booking process for the Multiple Purpose Sports Hall (MPSH) was manual and required users to check a Google Sheets timetable and communicate booking details via Telegram. The process was cumbersome and depended on a yearly student representative to manually update the booking records.

## Solution

Book4U solves this problem by offering an automated booking system accessible from its homepage. Users can easily submit booking requests, and administrators can log in to review and approve submitted bookings. The approved bookings are then reflected in the timetable displayed on the homepage, creating a seamless and efficient booking experience.

## Features

For detailed information about the system's features, as well as system and user testing, please refer to the [full project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lBbl30woSB4tnFogro37Me5kaN_AsGDz815Tp-ZH0GI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Built with ReactJS, utilizing Bootstrap and MUI (Material-UI), and hosted on Firebase.
- Backend: Developed using Go and Docker, with data stored in PostgreSQL. Hosted on Heroku.

## Motivation

As RC4 residents, we recognized the inefficiencies in the manual booking process for facilities like the Multiple Purpose Sports Hall, seminar rooms, and function rooms. Our motivation was to simplify and enhance this process for the benefit of students by creating a user-friendly and automated booking system.
