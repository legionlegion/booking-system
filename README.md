# Book4U

This is a full-stack project hosted [here](https://syal-2ae9b.firebaseapp.com/).

## Project Scope

A streamlined facility booking system for non-registered campus facilities for students who need to book spaces for group meetings, events, or projects.

## Problem

The booking schedule of RC4â€™s Multiple Purpose Sports Hall (MPSH) is updated manually via Google Sheets. Residents who wish to book the MPSH must first check the Google excel timetable, then text the POC via Telegram the booking details such as booking timing, number of users, purpose etc, to a student representative who is replaced yearly. This representative will then manually update the Google Sheets with the booking to reserve it.

## Solution

Our booking system will allow anyone to submit a booking request via the home page of the booking system. Admins will be able to login with accounts and view the list of all submitted bookings, and choose which are the ones to be approved. The updated request will be reflected on the timetable displayed on the homepage.

## Features of system

Detailed documentation of system features, system and user testing can be found in the [full project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lBbl30woSB4tnFogro37Me5kaN_AsGDz815Tp-ZH0GI/edit?usp=sharing)
